		<h1>Hobbies of a nerdy father</h1>
		<p>The basic hobby is gaming. Only been gaming on my pc for about 4 years. I built my new rig last semester.
		I used to cosplay when I had the time, between school, work, and my son I just dont have much free time. 
		I do love hiking and just walking in nature.</p>
